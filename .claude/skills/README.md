## Skill Coordination

### Option 1: Use lead-developer (Recommended)

Let the lead-developer orchestrate everything:

```bash
/lead-developer add WebSocket heartbeat with full tests and docs
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic delegation to experts
- ✅ All quality gates enforced
- ✅ Comprehensive output
- ✅ Less coordination overhead

---

### Option 2: Manual Delegation

Invoke skills individually for focused control:

```bash
# Step 1: Design
/software-architect design heartbeat mechanism

# Step 2: Implement
/senior-developer implement from ADR-XXX

# Step 3: Test
/qa-testing add tests for heartbeat

# Step 4: Document
/docs-manager update WebSocket docs
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ More control over each phase
- ✅ Can review between steps
- ✅ Focused expertise

---

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: New Feature

**Task:** Add WebSocket auto-reconnect

**With lead-developer:**
```bash
/lead-developer add WebSocket auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
```

Auto-delegates to:
1. software-architect → Design + ADR
2. senior-developer → Implementation
3. qa-testing → Tests (≥90%)
4. docs-manager → Documentation

---

### Example 2: Security Feature

**Task:** Add HTML sanitization

**With lead-developer:**
```bash
/lead-developer add HTML sanitization with XSS protection
```

Auto-delegates to:
1. security-reviewer → Design review
2. software-architect → ADR
3. senior-developer → Implementation
4. security-reviewer → Code audit
5. qa-testing → Security tests
6. docs-manager → Security docs

---

### Example 3: Simple Fix

**Task:** Fix typo in error message

**Direct approach:**
```bash
# Just edit the file - no skill needed
```

Or if you want validation:
```bash
/senior-developer fix typo in ReactivityError
```

---

## Quality Standards

All skills enforce:

- ✅ **Code Quality** - CLAUDE.md conventions
- ✅ **Test Coverage** - ≥90% for runtime modules
- ✅ **Documentation** - API docs + examples
- ✅ **Security** - No vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Architecture** - ADRs followed
- ✅ **Accessibility** - A11y standards maintained
- ✅ **Performance** - No regressions

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific

**❌ Bad:** "improve the router"
**✅ Good:** "optimize router path matching using RouteTrie for O(k) lookup"

### 2. Mention Constraints

**✅ Good:** "add caching while maintaining backward compatibility"

### 3. Specify Quality Needs

**✅ Good:** "implement X with security review and edge case tests"

### 4. Reference Context

**✅ Good:** "following ADR-042" or "similar to HTTP client pattern"

## Adding New Skills

To add a new skill:

1. Create directory: `.claude/skills/your-skill/`
2. Add `skill.json` with metadata
3. Add `instructions.md` with agent instructions
4. Add `README.md` with usage guide
5. Update this file with your skill
6. Update lead-developer's `delegatesTo` array (if applicable)

See existing skills for examples.
